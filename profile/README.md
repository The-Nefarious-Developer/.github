# Welcome to The Nefarious Developer ☕️

**_"Helping developers create and break things... but mostly create."_**

This organization was created to ~~try to~~ provide open-source packages, tools, and libraries for the brave souls working in **AI, SAP, and other corporate shenanigans**. Basically, if it helps developers and is mildly ridiculous, we're probably working on it.

## Our Vision (If We Actually Had One)

Our goal is to **empower developers** by providing resources that allow them to say, "Hey, I didn’t know I needed this, but it’s actually awesome." We aim to make the corporate dev experience a bit more tolerable—and maybe even *fun* (crazy, I know). In other words, we want you to look busy while secretly automating all your tasks so you can spend more time drinking coffee and browsing memes.

## Projects

Here are a few gems you might stumble upon in our repos:

- **devcontainer-templates**: Devcontainers for SAP devs who need their environment ready faster than it takes to say 'Business Technology Platform' — because nobody has time to manually install dependencies, right?
- **devcontainer-images**: Pre-built devcontainer images for SAP devs — because configuring development environments is so last season. Just plug, code, and impress your manager with how 'productive' you are!

## Contributing

Do you want to join the ranks of nefarious developers worldwide? Are you tired of making boring, serious software? Feel free to fork our projects, submit pull requests, or just **file an issue** to remind us we misspelled something (because we probably did).

## Community

We’re building a community of likeminded folks who appreciate a touch of humor amidst the chaos of enterprise development. You’ll find us in the following places:

- **Discussions**: Drop in and ask questions, share your best corporate memes, or tell us why our scripts broke your production environment.
- **Issues**: Report bugs, make feature requests, or just vent about the latest changes in SAP.


**Happy coding!** ✨
